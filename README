libpbuffer is a library for dynamic buffer handling written in C.

Using it is quite easy.
For example:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <pbuffer.h>

int main()
{
	pbuffer *buffer = pbuffer_new();
	pbuffer_set(buffer, "Hello ");
	printf("%s\n", buffer->data);
	printf("size is: %d\n", buffer->size);
	pbuffer_add(buffer, "world!\n");
	printf("%s", buffer->data);
	printf("size is: %d\n", buffer->size);
	pbuffer_free(buffer);
	return 0;
}

Compile the code with -lpbuffer and you're set.
That should do the trick with hello world.

More functions will appear as soon as they are needed, but for now that's it.

The buffer itself is just a typedef to a struct pbuffer:

struct pbuffer {
	ssize_t size;
	char *data;
};
